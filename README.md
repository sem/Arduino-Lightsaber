# Arduino-Lightsaber
This project is made to simulate a Light saber from Star Wars by using an Arduino Nano. This repository includes the Arduino code and the circuit diagram.

# Materials
Materials that I used to make the Light saber:
- Arduino Nano
- WS2812B LED strip
- Push button
- 330 Ohm resistor
- Resistor (1KOhm recommended)
- 1000 uF capacitor (not necessary)
- 4 AA 1.5v batteries

# Code
Before you upload the code to your Arduino you should have the following libraries installed:
- FastLED[https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/fastled/]
- OneButton[https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/onebutton/]
